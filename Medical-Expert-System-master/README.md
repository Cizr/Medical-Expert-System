An expert system using knowledge graphs
that aims to provide the patients with medical advice and basic
knowledge on various diseases

## Idea
Many rural areas in India have extremely limited access to medical advice. People travel long distances to clinics or medical facilities and there is a shortage of medical experts in most of these facilities. This results in slow service, and patients end up waiting long hours without receiving any attention. Hence, medical expert systems can play a significant role in such cases where medical experts are not readily available. A Diagnosis Expert System can help a great deal in identifying those diseases and describing methods of treatment to be carried out.

Design a knowledge-based expert system that aims to provide the patients with medical advice and basic knowledge on various diseases. It should consider various symptoms and signs like chest pain, cough, fainting, fatigue, headache, back pain, sunken eyes, low body temperature, restlessness, sore throat, fever etc. along with its severity status and provide the patients with medical advice.
